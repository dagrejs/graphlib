        :markdown
            Graphlib is a JavaScript library that provides data structures for
            undirected and directed multi-graphs along with algorithms that can
            be used with them.

            This documentation describes the Graphlib API. Please visit our
            [GitHub repository](https://github.com/cpettitt/graphlib) for
            more general information.

        h2 Graph Types
        :markdown
            There are currently four major graph types in graphlib:

            * [`Graph`](#Graph) represents an undirected multigraph
            * [`Digraph`](#Digraph) represents a directed multigraph
            * [`CGraph`](#CGraph) represents a compound undirected multigraph
            * [`CDigraph`](#CDigraph) represents a compound directed multigraph

            Multigraphs are graphs that can contain more than one edge between
            the same two nodes.

            Compound graphs are graphs that can have nodes that act as parents
            to, or containers of, other nodes.
